    "# üìã Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `orchestration.ipynb` notebook implements a **sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system** for insurance claim processing using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** and **Azure AI Agent Service**. This notebook demonstrates advanced concurrent agent coordination to analyze insurance claims from multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",
    "- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: Agent orchestration framework\n",
    "- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Cloud-based agent hosting and management\n",
    "- **Concurrent Orchestration**: Parallel execution of multiple AI agents\n",
    "- **Azure Cosmos DB Integration**: Real-time data access through custom plugins\n",
    "- **Azure Identity**: Secure authentication for Azure services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Specializations\n",
    "The system creates three specialized AI agents that work concurrently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Claim Reviewer Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates claim documentation completeness\n",
    "   - Analyzes damage assessments and cost estimates\n",
    "   - Identifies inconsistencies or missing information\n",
    "   - Provides VALID/QUESTIONABLE/INVALID determinations\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for data retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Analyzer Agent**\n",
    "   - Detects fraud patterns and suspicious indicators\n",
    "   - Assesses claim authenticity and credibility\n",
    "   - Analyzes timing, amounts, and circumstances\n",
    "   - Provides LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk assessments\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for historical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìã Policy Checker Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates coverage against policy terms\n",
    "   - Interprets limits, deductibles, and exclusions\n",
    "   - Handles multiple policy types (Auto, Commercial, Motorcycle, etc.)\n",
    "   - Provides COVERED/NOT COVERED/PARTIAL COVERAGE determinations\n",
    "   - Uses Azure AI Search for policy document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Key Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `create_specialized_agents()`\n",
    "- Establishes Azure AI Agent client connections\n",
    "- Configures each agent with specialized instructions and capabilities\n",
    "- Sets up Cosmos DB plugins for data-enabled agents\n",
    "- Configures polling options for optimal performance\n",
    "- Returns a collection of ready-to-use specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### `run_insurance_claim_orchestration()`\n",
    "- **Concurrent Processing**: All three agents analyze claims simultaneously\n",
    "- **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Each agent receives specialized instructions\n",
    "- **Real-time Data Access**: Agents can retrieve claim data using provided claim IDs\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates unified analysis reports combining all agent outputs\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management and resource cleanup\n",
    "- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging of orchestration stages\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Orchestration Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Creation**: Initializes three specialized insurance processing agents\n",
    "2. **Concurrent Orchestration Setup**: Creates parallel execution framework\n",
    "3. **Task Distribution**: Assigns specialized analysis tasks to each agent\n",
    "4. **Parallel Execution**: All agents work simultaneously on their respective analyses\n",
    "5. **Result Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates outputs from all agents\n",
    "6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis report with all findings\n",
    "7. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly terminates runtime and releases resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates a comprehensive **Insurance Claim Analysis Report** that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Agent Assessments**: Detailed analysis from each specialized perspective\n",
    "- **Claim Validity Status**: Complete documentation and accuracy assessment\n",
    "- **Risk Profile Analysis**: Fraud indicators and authenticity evaluation\n",
    "- **Policy Coverage Determination**: Coverage eligibility and terms validation\n",
    "- **Unified Recommendations**: Consolidated next steps based on all agent analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent Execution**: True parallelism for faster processing\n",
    "- **Database Integration**: Real-time access to claim and policy data\n",
    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "- I am able to confirm that the policy \"LIAB-AUTO-001\" corresponds to an automobile liability coverage insurance product.\n",
      "- Coverage, limits, and deductibles typically define the scope of liability coverage, damage types covered, maximum payout limits, and out of pocket costs, but since specific policy clauses or exclusions are not explicitly extracted here, a fully granular determination cannot be given without further text inspection.\n",

      "Analysis:\n",
      "- Claim Details: The claim \"CL001\" involves a 2004 Honda Accord that was damaged in a parking lot accident on July 17, 2025. The claimant reported significant damage to the front and driver's side including a dislodged bumper, severe denting, wheel and tire damage, and potential hidden mechanical damage.\n",
      "- Documentation: The claim includes photos of the damage, a police report from Springfield Police Dept., and a repair estimate from Springfield Auto Body. The damage descriptions and photos align well, supporting the reported incident.\n",
      "- Damage Assessment: Visible damages and description are consistent with a collision in a parking lot. The presence of a spare tire and misalignment support mechanical damage claims.\n",
      "- Completeness: The claim has witness information, police report, repair estimates, and photographic evidence, appearing thorough.\n",
      "- Policy: No direct policy document was found by policy number ‚ÄúLIAB-AUTO-001‚Äù in the search, leaving coverage verification incomplete.\n",

      "- Confirmation required if claimant‚Äôs deductible was considered or if the claim request matches policy terms.\n",

      "1. Obtain and review the actual insurance policy \"LIAB-AUTO-001\" document to confirm coverage, deductible amounts, and exclusions.\n",
      "2. Verify the repair cost estimate in detail against industry standards for similar damages.\n",
      "3. Confirm claimant‚Äôs deductible and ensure claim request aligns with coverage limits.\n",
      "4. If policy coverage is confirmed and repair estimate reasonable, approve credit minus deductible.\n",
      "5. If policy coverage or amount is questionable, request additional documentation or clarification from claimant before approval.\n",
